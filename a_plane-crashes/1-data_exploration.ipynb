    "On September 11th, 2001, terrorists hijacked two Boeing 767 airplanes and carried out a suicide attack. These planes crashed into the World Trade Center twin towers in New York City, killing almost 3000 people and causing both buildings to collapse. We will explore what impact this tragedy had on US airlines.\n",
